# Problem Solving

A Personal Repository to include implementation for known issues from HackerRank website and implementation of some known algorithms.

**Sorting algorithms implemented**
- `BubbleSort`
- `InsertionSort`
- `MergSort`
---
**DataStructures implemented**
- `LinkedList`

---
The executable should be located inside /build folder under name application
